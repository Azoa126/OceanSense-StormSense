&nbsp;1. Abstract



A concise summary (~150 words) describing the motivation, datasets used (OBIS + IMD/IBTrACS), analytical approach, and the goal of building a decision-support framework for fisheries and cyclone resilience.

&nbsp;2. Introduction



\* Context of fisheries in the Indian Subcontinent

\* Increasing frequency/intensity of tropical cyclones

\* The scientific need to link oceanic hazards with fishery distribution and activity

\* Overview of your integrated approach



---



&nbsp;3. Objectives



\* Build an open-access, interactive web platform integrating fisheries and cyclone data.

\* Visualize species distributions and historical cyclone tracks.

\* Identify spatial-temporal overlap between fishing zones and cyclone-affected areas.

\* Develop tools for awareness and decision support.

&nbsp;4. Methodology



Data Sources:



\* OBIS Fisheries (species occurrence data)

\* IMD/IBTrACS Cyclone Records (1891–2021)

\* NOAA/NASA (climate baselines)



Tools \& Frameworks:



\* Frontend: React, Next.js, TailwindCSS

\* Visualization: Plotly.js, Leaflet

\* Backend: JSON and CSV datasets served via `/public`

\* Data Cleaning: Python (pandas), R (for initial exploration)



Modules Developed:



1\. OceanSense — fisheries visualization dashboard

2\. StormSense — cyclone trend and live tracker

3\. Neritic Chatbot — knowledge layer (in progress)



---



&nbsp;5. Results



\* Prototype functional dashboard developed.

\* Fisheries data mapped by species and region.

\* Cyclone visualization layer structured.

\* JSON registry created for expanding fishery knowledge.

\* Consistent user interface built with cohesive color scheme.



---



&nbsp;6. Discussion



\* Insights gained from mapping fisheries hotspots vs cyclone-prone zones.

\* Implications for fisheries sustainability and policy design.

\* Potential applications for marine research, coastal planning, and outreach.



---



&nbsp;7. Future Work



\* Integration of live cyclone data feed (NOAA).

\* Time-series analysis of species abundance vs cyclone frequency.

\* Implementation of chatbot module with local fishery knowledge.

\* Deployment on Vercel/Netlify with public access link.
