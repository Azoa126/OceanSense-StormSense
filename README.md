🌊 OceanSense-StormSense
Integrated Climate & Fisheries Monitoring Platform
OceanSense-StormSense is a unified platform designed to visualize, analyze, and understand how oceanic and climate events—such as fisheries trends and cyclones—impact marine ecosystems and coastal communities across the Indian Subcontinent.

🧩 Core Concept
This project connects multiple data-driven modules under a shared mission:
OceanSense: Fisheries data visualization and insights
StormSense: Cyclone patterns and impact tracking
Shared Mission: Understand the interplay between ocean events, climate phenomena, and coastal communities
Current Status: Vision finalized, technical foundation laid.
